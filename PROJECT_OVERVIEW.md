# Project Overview: Go Algorithms Playground

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as a comprehensive educational resource and practical toolkit for learning and implementing fundamental computer science algorithms and data structures in Go. It's designed for:

- **Students** learning algorithms and data structures
- **Developers** preparing for technical interviews
- **Go enthusiasts** wanting to see idiomatic Go implementations
- **Anyone** interested in algorithm performance analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Package Organization

```
github.com/prulloac/go-playground/
├── algorithms/          # Algorithm implementations organized by category
├── data_structures/     # Data structure implementations
├── benchmarks/          # Performance benchmarking code
├── utils/              # Common utility functions
└── examples/           # Usage demonstrations
```

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity over Cleverness**: Code is written to be easily understood
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Every algorithm has extensive test coverage
3. **Performance Analysis**: Time and space complexity documented
4. **Go Idioms**: Follows Go best practices and conventions
5. **Modularity**: Each algorithm/data structure is self-contained

## 📚 Educational Features

### Documentation Standards
- Time and space complexity analysis for every algorithm
- Clear comments explaining the approach
- Examples of when to use each algorithm
- Performance trade-offs discussion

### Testing Methodology
- Unit tests covering edge cases
- Property-based testing where applicable
- Benchmark tests for performance analysis
- Example-based tests for clarity

### Learning Path Suggestions

**Beginner Level:**
1. Start with `algorithms/sorting` - understand basic algorithms
2. Explore `data_structures/linked_list` - fundamental data structure
3. Try `algorithms/searching` - basic search techniques

**Intermediate Level:**
1. Study `algorithms/dynamic_programming` - optimization techniques
2. Explore `algorithms/graph` - graph traversal algorithms
3. Implement `data_structures/heap` - priority queue operations

**Advanced Level:**
1. Analyze `benchmarks/` - understand performance characteristics
2. Study complex graph algorithms (when implemented)
3. Explore advanced string algorithms

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Adding New Algorithms

1. **Choose Category**: Place in appropriate `algorithms/` subdirectory
2. **Implement**: Write clean, documented Go code
3. **Test**: Add comprehensive unit tests
4. **Benchmark**: Add performance benchmarks if relevant
5. **Document**: Update README and add complexity analysis

### Code Quality Standards

- **go fmt**: All code must be properly formatted
- **go vet**: Static analysis must pass
- **go test**: All tests must pass
- **Benchmarks**: Performance-critical code should have benchmarks
- **Documentation**: Public functions must have doc comments

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Benchmarking Strategy
- Multiple input sizes tested
- Memory allocation tracking
- CPU profiling available
- Comparison between algorithm variants

### Optimization Guidelines
- Prefer readability unless performance is critical
- Document any performance optimizations
- Include both naive and optimized versions when educational

## 🎓 Educational Use Cases

### Interview Preparation
- Common interview algorithms implemented
- Multiple approaches shown (iterative vs recursive)
- Time/space complexity analysis provided
- Edge cases covered in tests

### Academic Study
- Classic textbook algorithms implemented
- Clear naming and documentation
- Step-by-step explanations in comments
- Visual ASCII art for complex algorithms (where helpful)

### Professional Development
- Production-ready implementations
- Error handling patterns
- Go-specific optimizations
